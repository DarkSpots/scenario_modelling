## Supporting code for generating figures and scenario modelling

This code is used for running the scenario models and for generating plotting elements of Figure 1, 2, 3 and 5, as well as SI Figures S1-S30 and SI Table S1. This code relies on information from the literate analysis (https://github.com/DarkSpots/LiteRate_analysis), from the time-to-event analysis (10.5281/zenodo.11110630; i.e. SI Table S2 and S3) as well as from the United Nations Sustainable Goals data (https://sdgs.un.org/goals), and from wcvp (https://powo.science.kew.org/about-wcvp). 

Please unzip  https://github.com/DarkSpots/scenario_modelling/data.zip and use that as the basepath in the code for it to run.

Code is broken down into steps 00 to 08 and need to be run in that order.
