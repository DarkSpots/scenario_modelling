## Supporting code for generating figures and scenario modelling

This code is used for generating table S1 using information from SI Table S2 and S3, and from the United Nations Sustainable Goals data (https://sdgs.un.org/goals) , and from wcvp for plotting elements of Figure 1, 2, 3 and 5, as well as SI Figures S1-S30.

Please unzip the Unzip https://github.com/DarkSpots/scenario_modelling/data.zip and use that as the basepath in the code for it to run.
